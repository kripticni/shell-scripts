we open the file in wireshark
and we inspect the tcp payloads

cGljb0NURg== this packet was 
out of order, but decoded its still
"picoCTF" so we know we found the way
to solve the problem

XzM0c3lfdA== trasnlates to _34sy_t
MzE4ZGIyMg== translates to 318db22
[ezF0X3c0cw== translates to {1t_w4s (this packet was out of order)
YmhfNHJfZg== translates to bh_4r_f
bnRfdGg0dA== translates to nt_th4t

so it goes

picoCTF{1t_w4snt_th4t_34sy_tbh_4r_f318db22}
