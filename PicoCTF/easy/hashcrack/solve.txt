we connect with netcat and acquire
482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38

so now we obviously just need to crack it
using hash-identifier (hashid also works)
we can see

 HASH: 482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38

Possible Hashs:
[+] MD5
[+] Domain Cached Credentials - MD4(MD4(($pass)).(strtolower($username)))
both tools mainly recognize md5 
so we assume its md5

cracking would take too long on my machine so
i use a website that has hashes cached
we get, password123

and we obtain the next hash
b7a875fc1ea228b9061041b7cec4bd3c52ab3ce3
using the same two tools we see that it is 
a md1 hash
and even my machine can easily crack md1
and we get 'letmein'

for the finale we get
916e8c4f79b25028c9e467f1eb8eee6d6bbdff965f9928310ad30a8d88697745
now this we see is a sha256 hash, thats hard to crack
however our site has us covered and we get the flag
