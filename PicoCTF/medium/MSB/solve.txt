ive tried to reverse the MSB to LSB using xxd 
as in pervious forensics challenges but that 
was to no help, so then i searched for a
script that would analyse MSB orientation
and i found sigBits.py by Pulho on github

after reading the README i got
into my debian-12 distrobox to 
run the python script

distrobox create --name debian-stable --image debian:12 #i already had one
distrobox enter debian-stable

then we get the necessary packages

sudo apt install python3 pip pipx python3-pillow

then get the script and run it with -t=msb for 
msb analysis, out of there we get a file called outputSB,
then i used bvi to look for pico and i located the flag
