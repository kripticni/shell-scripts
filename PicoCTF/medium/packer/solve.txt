initially i didnt know much on
binary packing, so i tried to 
disassemble the output as usual,
however that gave no output
then i xxd-ed and saw some 
very unusual entropy for a bin 
file

i tried to run a file and it 
asked for a password so i 
figured if its just an executable
it should be stored in plaintext
so i ran strings on it, and 
found the following:

"$Info: This file is packed with the UPX executable packer http://upx.sf.net $
$Id: UPX 3.95 Copyright (C) 1996-2018 the UPX Team. All Rights Reserved. $"

as well as UPX! at the start and
end of file, so i looked into it
and got it on my system

after reading the help page 
for upx i found the decompress 
flag, and after that we got 
a valid file to disassemble

after running strings and filtering
strings out | grep -v _ | fgrep -v .
i found the following:

"Enter the password to unlock this file:
You entered: %s
Password correct, please see flag: 7069636f4354467b5539585f556e5034636b314e365f42316e34526933535f31613561336633397d
Access denied"

but i felt that was the easier way
to the flag, so i decided to
readelf to see the sections
and noticed there is both
.rodata and .data
objdump -s -j .rodata out | awk -F'\t' '{print $NF}' | less
and you can find the same string that way

the other way would using
pwndbg or ghidra

in any case
bytes.fromhex("7069636f4354467b5539585f556e5034636b314e365f42316e34526933535f31613561336633397d").decode("ascii")
