in the first page
we dont know any valid user but in the 
query provided after failing to login 
we can see that the password goes before the
user in the query

this means that as our password we can put

' OR '1'='1' --
the -- at the end will count everything else
as a comment so we got a query that will show
us the entire table

SELECT id FROM users WHERE password = '' OR '1'='1' -- AND username = 'asd'

the kampala entry has the address "Maybe all the tables"
so for the second sql injection we need to find all the tables
except we are going in blind this time since we cant see the structure
of the sql query they have

Kampala' UNION SELECT sql,'pad','pad' FROM sqlite_master --

sqlite_master is a table for sqlite that contains information
about all other tables, and the sql collumn is the one with
info around the tables creation, we use union to conjoin the
two statements and get all the tables

tables are: hints, more_table, offices, users

we can see that the more_table has a collumn flag
so thats exactly what we are after

Kampala' UNION SELECT flag,'pad','pad' FROM more_table --

and this grants us the flag
