do the usual as in operation orchid and disk-sleugh-2

by trying to login with ssh key-less we can see 
that it requires a private key, so thats our target

fls -p -r -o ****** -f *** disk.img | grep ssh

we can find both the private and a public key
we now use icat (or fcat) to get the contents of
the private key and redirect them to key_file

now trying to login would say that we have wrong
permissions for our key_file, but a simple
chmod 600 key_file
fixes that quickly

we log into the machine and cat the flag
that is in our home directory
