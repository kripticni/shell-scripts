from other forensics challenge it is
pretty easy to recongnise that this
is a reverse jpeg file from the
JFIF at the beginning and from the
wrongly typed in string of letters
at the beginning of every jpeg
since this is a 32 bit machine 
we do this to reverse it

xxd -e -g4 challengefile | xxd -r > file_reversed.bin

we use -e to get a little endian dump that
is grouped by 4 bytes (or 32 bits)
(it doesnt matter if the original was 
little or big endian, this works regardless
since xxd by default dumps the big endian
way of it seeing the hex, and this switches
that to little)

then we reverse that operation with -r
to get back the binary
(you can even do the same for file_reversed.bin
to reconstruct the original challenge file with
an EOF byte at the end)
