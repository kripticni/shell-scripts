as our username we do whatever
and for the password we inject

' or '1'='1

and we successfully login due to the query being:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='kripticni' AND password='' or '1'='1'

now the site doesnt gives us the flag right away
but it says that its in plainsight, so we 
inspect the page to find the flag laying
there in a hidden paragraph element
