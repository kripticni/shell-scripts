for your email, you can find it in the source
picoplayer355@picoctf.org
and since mongodb is nosql, we can inject it with
{ "$ne": null }
which would return true for any field not null

now we get to /admin
and there is nothing there

however if we analyse the response with wireshark
we'll see that the server responds with a js obj
and a token which is base64 encoded
decoding it gives us the flag
