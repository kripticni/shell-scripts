i was already somewhat familiarized with
morse code, but ive never tried learning it
on my own nor listening to any to decipher it
so i decided to try myself on this ctf

.-- .... ....- --...
.... ....- --... ....
----. ----- -..
.-- ..--- ----- ..- ----. .... --...

i managed to write this down by hand
and translate it manually, add pauses
at new lines and that was the flag

another simpler solution would have been to
use a spectrogram (with logarithim scale)
and a translator, but that wouldn't have been
as fun
