there is two ways to solve this
ctf, the first is using regexes
to match binary names and the
second is to use $- and splice 
strings, ill be doing the regexes
because they are much faster

after doing ./* we can see the 
exact location of the flag, so then
we just simply want to run 

/???/??[!6]?64 ./*/????????

we need to run base64 like this
because instead it would try to 
run x86_64, and this will give 
us a base64 encoded flag that 
we can just decode
