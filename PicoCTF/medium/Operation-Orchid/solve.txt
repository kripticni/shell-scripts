same process for the beginning like
sleughkit-apprentice, then you find three files
in /root 
flag.txt (shreded)
flag.txt.enc
.bash_history

reading out .bash_history gives you 
the tools the perp used to encrypt
the flag, so you can use

openssl aes256 -d -salt -in flag.txt.enc -out flag.txt -k unbreakablepassword1234567

to decrypt it, and get the flag
