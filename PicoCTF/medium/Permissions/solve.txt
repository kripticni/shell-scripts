a privilage escalation based ctf
we dont have any files in our home dir 
nor any useful scripts

but if we check 
sudo -l 
we can see that we have
access to vi

if we run vi, we can 
see that we have a plugin
that lets us traverse the fs
so after that we just navigate
to /root/flag.txt and read
the contents
