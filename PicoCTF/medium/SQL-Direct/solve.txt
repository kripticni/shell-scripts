similarly like the second part of
the More SQL flag, there is also
somewhat of a master table for postgre
too, its called pg_tables

however this contains system tables
that we arent interested in so we
set the schemaname parameter to be
equal to 'public'

SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';

and we get:
 tablename
-----------
 flags
(1 row)

so now that we know the name of the table with our flag
we do a very simple

SELECT * FROM flags;

and we retrieve the flag
