its pretty simple
first i wrote a program to let me
actually humanly read the bytes in
the level3.hash.bin and then i cracked the hash

john --incremental hash.txt --fork=4 --format=raw-MD5
john hash.txt --show --format=raw-MD5

?:865e

the idea was to try each combination in the program but 
that didnt really seem professional
