i have already studied modular arithmetic and 
the needed algorithms in school and for 
my competetive programming competition i did gcd
i was very familiar with the modular inverse from
doing some RSA a long time ago, so this challenge
was pretty easy

i believe an even easier way would have been
to just take the modulus 41 result and calculate
the power of it to -1 with 41

also the formatter
really wants the numbers array to look
the way it does and its hard to argue 
with it so i wont bother
