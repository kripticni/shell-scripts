i instantly saw the solution
but i just had no clue how to implement it

you need to read rip from the call instruction
with format string
calculate the offset to print_flag function from main
and then with format string
write the address to the rip on the stack
so that it returns to th print_flag function

so first we disassemble it
the offset is 0x1401 - 0x1269 = 408 bytes
the stack in echo_valley is 0x70 + rbp = 120 bytes

for format string we would want
5 + 120/8 + 1 = 21 to get rip
and 20 for rbp

the recieved address ends with 413, same as 
the mov instruction in main so thats our 
confirmation
