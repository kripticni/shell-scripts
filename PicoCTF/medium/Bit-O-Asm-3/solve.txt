slightly more obfuscated
	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0xc],0x9fe1a
	mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0xc]
so eax is 0x9fe1a
	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x4
	imul   eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
multiplying those two gives us
2619496
and to that we 
	add    eax,0x1f5
and this only serves as obfuscation
	mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],eax
	mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]
so we get the flag, only a slight inconvinience
