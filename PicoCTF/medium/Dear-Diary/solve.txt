this one was quite challenging because im only familiar with sdk
we do the usual mmls and fsstat and fls

we find a couple of files in
/root but none of them are all
that useful, even .ash_history is
really useless

in the challenge it pretty much says that
if we cat out the files we will miss out 
on information

so we have to look at the hex output
also considering the name is "Dear Diary"
we can consider that another word for journal
and if the filesystem's mode=journal it will
also store the file changes
(the default is ordered which only stores the metadata,
a journal is a file that tracks changes before they are 
commited to disk, its useful for integrity and recovery)

the journal's inode is 8, we also know the offset
what we are looking for and how to look for it

icat -o 1140736 disk.flag.img 8 | xxd | grep -A 5 -B 2 txt

and it shows us all the fragmented flag pieces
from the first 8 sectors

piece them together and you get the flag
