giving an image and explaining what
matryoshka dolls are only associated me
of file embedding for which we know to 
use binwalk, originally i "binwalk --extract"-ed
twice and then i remembered knowing of a 
recursive option for binwalk

looked at the help page and was taken by
suprise to see --matryoshka

obviously the next thing i ran was 
rm -rf extractions
binwalk dolls.jpg --extract --matryoshka

i let tab autocomplete guide my filepath
to the final flag.txt, i catted it out
and there was the flag
