if you were to run file on Forensics\ is\ fun.pptm
it would tell you its just a 2007 microsoft powerpoint
presentation, but if know a little more about these 
types of files you would have first thought of it
simply being a zip archive, it is one by its 
magic number too but file also checks the file headers

after unzipping the file i tried to just quickly run
$ grep -Irli pico . 
but that didnt work, so i decided to look at
the structure of the archive with
$ tree
if you dont have tree, $ file .
would have been a good substituion but
i find tree to be much more human readable

in the output one file caught my attention
./ppt/slideMasters/hidden
cating it have me some characters that were
obviously way out of place, but it also
perfectly fit the criteria for base64
so i did

$ base64 -d <(cat hidden | tr -d ' ')

and that was enough to secure the flag
