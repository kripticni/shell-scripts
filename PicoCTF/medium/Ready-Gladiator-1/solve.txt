hunter lost 100 battles,
it weakness is that the enemy
may move unpredictably, and
the enemy must have been even
quicker than the hunter

stone made 100 draws,
its fast and effective
against slow opponents
but it likely missed 
because the enemy was 
too unpredictable

paper also made 100 draws,
means that its not insanely fast

and imp made 100 draws,
means that the enemy is 
not too aggressive

i tried to get the best
of both by making a 
hybrid imp bomber
however 100 draws

based on this i was
able to deduce that 
the enemy was incredibly
passive and unpredictable
so i made a bomber which
would focus on destroying
everything as aggresivelly 
and unpredictably, and 
it resulted in 14 victories
