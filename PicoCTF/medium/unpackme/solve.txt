first, when downloading the file i immediatly noticed
the upx in the name, it was familiar from another
way earlier ctf where i first discovered binary
packers and the upx packer

i unpacked the binary with upx -d
then i ran strings and found nothing
so i booted up my debian distrobox
to run the binary

running the binary asked
"Whats my favorite number"
so i disassembled the binary
with objdump and looked through it
in nvim, first finding main then
finding the cmps in main

one cmp i noticed was immediatly after 
a scan, so that must have been the one
i turned the hex into a decimal using
python and then inputed it into the program
which resulted in us getting the flag
