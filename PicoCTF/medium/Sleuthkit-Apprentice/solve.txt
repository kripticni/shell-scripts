use mmls to see the partitions on
the disk image and their corresponding offsets

use fsstat to find out what kind 
of filesystems they are

the first one is /boot/ and you wont 
find anything important there after you
use fls -o 2048 disk.flag.img -f ext4

the third partition is the main 
disk where you can recursively list with -r 
all files and use -p to show the full paths

grep for anything containing flag 
and then use either icat or fcat 
to get the contents and the flag
