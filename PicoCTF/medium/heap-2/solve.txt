with gdb disas i was able to read that
the address of win was
0x00000000004011a0

so thats what we need to write
into the x variable, so when
it gets called it'll move the rip
to the function

the address is 
0x00000000004011a0, but thats in big endian
to little endian it would be
0xa011400000000000

variables are once again 32 bytes apart
so the payload is
32 bytes + reversed endian of address + enter

so i wrote up a quick python script
that will fetch the ip through dns
connect to the socket and send the payload
