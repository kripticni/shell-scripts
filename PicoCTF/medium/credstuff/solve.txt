firstly extract the archive
tar xf leak.tar

to get the flag i did
paste usernames.txt passwords.txt | grep cultiris
cultiriscvpbPGS{P7e1S_54I35_71Z3}

i immediatly noticed the rot13 here
then i did a quick tr to get the flag
also wrote a short bash script which
could be an alias

#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo "$1" | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
