this one was interesting
and not as horrendous as the last one

obviously you free the object initially
first off i tried of just allocating pico over the entire heap
in hopes of overwriting it since i was given the access to that
unfortunetly due to the implementation of the glibc allocator 
that would likely never happen before a segfault

so then i decided to read more on the glibc allocator
and i found that glibc keeps an array of fast alloc bins
these are blocks of less than 64 bytes, so i instantly knew
that if i was to just dealloc the obj and request an alloc
of the same size, it would give me the same address

the rest was easy, you pad the initial 30 bytes and then 
write pico
