you should read/solve the prequel ctf before this one

this one also has a logic flaw but its an intentional one
to read the flag we want to use data_read but that is 
not possible when we have inputed 0 things into data_write

so firstly, we input anything into data_write to get
access to data_read, and from there we see that 
we can get the flag if strtol evaluates to 0

this means string to long, and if our input is
0 it will succesfully print out our flag
also our inputs/entries from data_read
start with 1, but the program never checks 
for 0 and that was the idea the creator 
had in mind to demonstrate im pretty sure
