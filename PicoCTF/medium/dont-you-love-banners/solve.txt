from the socket leak given in the 
text of the ctf, we got the login password
and the security questions were some
generally common knowledge too

after getting into the server
we got to /root/ and saw
the file the server is running as
a login script, and the flag in plaintext

however we weren't given sufficient permissions
to read the flag.txt's content
then i checked the running processes and ps -u root
to see the privilage level of the server script
my first thought was to change the server's code
into reading it for us, since it had sufficient privilages

however there was no text editor so i tried to change it with 
sed -i 's/\/home\/player\/banner/\/root\/flag/g' script.py
and then realised i dont have the permissions to alter the
file at all

so i figured i need to abuse the filesystem instead
as the server script opened /home/player/banner regardless of
what it was

so i simply removed the banner, and added a symlink with
the same name to /root/flag.txt
upon opening nc to the server again
the python script hands us the flag
