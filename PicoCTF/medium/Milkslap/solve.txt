firstly i went to the page and
then sources to download the gif/image directly

i noticed that it is a png which could only mean
i was meant to run zsteg on it, however zsteg
kept crashing due to not enough stack space with
this error message

/nix/store/7nzvhcg16crip2axzsxgpzi7rf8kq8r5-ruby3.3-zpng-0.4.5/lib/ruby/gems/3.3.0/gems/zpng-0.4.5/lib/zpng/scan_line.rb:369:in `prev_scanline_byte': stack level too deep (SystemStackError)

i firstly attempted simply giving it unlimited stack space
using ulimit -s unlimited but that resulted in the kernel
killing the process after it used up 10 gigabytes of my memory

the second thing i did was notice in the error message that 
zsteg is written in ruby, so i looked up how to resolve
the problem with this error with stack space and this
came up as the solution

export RUBY_THREAD_VM_STACK_SIZE=10000000

after it, zsteg gave us the flag right away
and i also updated my NixOS configuration with
this export
